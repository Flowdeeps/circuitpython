Troubleshooting
==============================

From time to time, an error occurs when working with CircuitPython. Here are a
variety of errors that can happen, what they mean and how to fix them.

File system issues
------------------------------

If your host computer starts complaining that your CIRCUITPY drive is corrupted
or files cannot be overwritten or deleted, then you will have to erase it completely.
When CircuitPython restarts it will create a fresh empty CIRCUITPY filesystem.

This often happens on Windows when the CIRCUITPY disk is not safely ejected
before being reset by the button or being disconnected from USB. This can also
happen on Linux and Mac OSX but its less likely.

.. danger:: This will erase all your files in CIRCUITPY!

#. Download the appropriate flash erase uf2 from `here <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SPIFlash/tree/master/examples/flash_erase_express>`_.
#. Double-click the reset button.
#. Copy the appropriate .uf2 to the xxxBOOT drive.
#. The on-board NeoPixel will turn blue, indicating the erase has started.
#. After about 15 seconds, the NexoPixel will start flashing green. If it flashes red, the erase failed.
#. Double-click again and load the appropriate `CircuitPython .uf2 <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/releases/latest>`_.

ValueError: Incompatible .mpy file.
-------------------------------------

This error occurs when importing a module that is stored as a `mpy` binary file
(rather than a `py` text file) that was generated by a different version of
CircuitPython than the one its being loaded into. Most versions are compatible
but, rarely they aren't. In particular, the `mpy` binary format changed between
CircuitPython versions 1.x and 2.x.

So, if you just upgraded to 2.x from 1.x you'll need to download a newer version
of the library. They are all available in the
`Adafruit bundle <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/latest>`_
and the `Community bundle <https://github.com/adafruit/CircuitPython_Community_Bundle/releases/latest>`_.
Make sure to download a version with 2.0.0 or higher in the filename.
